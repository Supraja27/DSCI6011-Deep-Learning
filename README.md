Cotton Plant Disease Prediction
# Overview:
This project aims to develop a deep learning solution for predicting diseases in cotton plants based on leaf images. The models utilize deep learning architectures, including InceptionV3 and ResNet50, to classify images as healthy or diseased.
# Dataset:
We use a comprehensive examination of a dataset obtained from Kaggle, consisting of images depicting cotton plants categorized into healthy and diseased classes. The dataset was meticulously organized into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of our deep learning model. Each image was labeled and divided into four distinct categories: fresh cotton leaf, fresh cotton plant, diseased cotton leaf, and diseased cotton plant.
